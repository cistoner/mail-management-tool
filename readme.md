Extra info

	Objective of this application will be to provide an open source solution to handle bunch of email 
	Subscribers one has for their website!
	
	We may gradually extend service to SMS subscriber management as well.

**These are certain points we have thought of:**

With this tool webmasters would be able to easily manage their email subscribers, add, sort or remove them to groups so that they can send bulk emails depending upon groups or to all of them. This application should be able to easily integrate with existing database of email subscribers if they maintain any. Admins should be able to add further sub admins or admins and add or modify permissions to them. We shall use Access Control  Iist model here Admin should be able to [add/edit/modify] aka AEM the source email address from which the mails would be sent to users but we shall restrict use of other domain names (other than their own) for source email addresses.
beta version: added support for sms API for managing subscriber by phone sms
